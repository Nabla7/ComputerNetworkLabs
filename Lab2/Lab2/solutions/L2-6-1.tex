No fragmentation is observed. Since Path MTU Discovery is used, it is possible to find the smallest MTU size along the network path before sending packets. In this case, h1 would discover that the path to h2 has an MTU size of 1280 bytes and would send packets with a size equal to or less than 1280 bytes, avoiding fragmentation.
