It's performed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item h1 sends a big packet to h2.
    \item r1 sees the packet is too big for the link to h2.
    \item r1 drops the packet and tells h1 the maximum allowed size (1280 bytes).
    \item h1 adjusts packet size to 1280 bytes or less.
    \item h1 sends smaller packets to h2, avoiding the need for fragmentation.
\end{itemize}
