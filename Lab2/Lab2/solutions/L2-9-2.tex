To identify slow start phase changes on the graph, observe the blue line's slope change. Initially, it increases gradually, but then it becomes less steep or even decreases, indicating the sender is experiencing congestion and adjusting its rate accordingly. This slower rate helps maintain network stability and avoid packet loss.
