The first packet containing data is packet no 5. The sequence number is 2997518125. The sequence number for the first byte of data sent from the TCP client (h1) to the TCP server (h2) will be the initial sequence number from the SYN packet plus 1. This is because the SYN flag consumes one byte in the sequence number space, even though it doesn't carry actual data.
