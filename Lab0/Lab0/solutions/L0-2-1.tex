If we have a look at packet 5 in the libpcap trace, whose Protocol is ICMP then we find that this protocol has the following fields: \begin{itemize}
    \item Type
    \item Code
    \item Checksum
    \item Checksum Status
    \item Identifier (BE)
    \item Identifier (LE)
    \item Sequence number (BE)
    \item Sequence number (LE)
    \item Response frame
    \item Timestamp from icmp data
    \item Timestamp from icmp data (relative)
    \item Data
\end{itemize}
 The amount of data present in packet 5 is 48 bytes. The number of bytes required to actually transmit the data seems to be 98, as it says that 98 bytes were "on wire".
