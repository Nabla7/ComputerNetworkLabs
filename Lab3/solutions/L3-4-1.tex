A DHCP leases file is used to keep track of all address bindings that the DHCP server has provided. It consists of the following elements:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Lease Time:} Duration for which the lease is valid. After this period, the client needs to renew the lease.
    \item \textbf{Client Identifier:} Typically the MAC address of the client that has leased the IP address.
    \item \textbf{Client Hostname:} The name of the host that has leased the IP address.
    \item \textbf{Lease Start and End Time:} When the lease started and when it will end.
\end{enumerate}
