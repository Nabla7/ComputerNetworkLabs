A different ICMP message is used. The ICMP message for IPv4 end-to-end fragmentation has a code of "Destination unreachable (Fragmentation needed)". In case of IPv6 fragmentation, this is "Packet Too Big". Another difference would be the version of ICMP used.

TODO: wat is het main verschil (als er 1 is)?
