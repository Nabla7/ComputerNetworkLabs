An example in \linktrace{pcapng} is packet 9. There are three ICMP options:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prefix information: Used by hosts as subnet prefix
    \item Recursive DNS server: Used by hosts as DNS
    \item Source link-layer address: Used to identify who sent the ICMP message
\end{enumerate}
