In case of IPv6, only the sender can fragment. This means that the sender has to determine the smallest MTU value on the path from source to destination. In \linktrace{eth0.pcapng}, we can see an ICMP message being sent back to the sender to indicate that 1280 is the smallest MTU value on the path. Thus, because only the source can fragment and not any intermediate nodes, H1 fragments the IPv6 packets and retransmits them. In case of IPv4, we see that the UDP datagrams in the same trace are sent without fragmentation. When looking at \linktrace{eth1.pcapng} however, we see that they are fragmented after all, by the intermediate router instead of the source host.
