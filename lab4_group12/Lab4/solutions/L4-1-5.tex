The goal of traceroute is to get an overview of the route that a packet takes to get to a destination. It starts by sending a packet with a TTL of 1, causing the first-hop router to send an ICMP message back to the source. The TTL is incremented and this process is repeated until a 'Destination Unreachable (Port unreachable)' message is returned to the host. This response indicates that the end of the path was reached but that no application was running on the UDP port. We can also use ICMP messages instead of UDP. In this case, we simply wait for a ICMP ping reply instead of a 'Destination Unreachable (Port unreachable)' message.
