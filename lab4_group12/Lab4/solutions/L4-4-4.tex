Packet 830 \& 831: OSPF LS Update packets - These packets are used to share link-state information with OSPF neighbors. In this case, the LS Update packets are sent due to the change in the network topology when the first interface was brought down.

Packet 846 \& 847: OSPF LS Acknowledge packets - These packets acknowledge the receipt of LS Update packets, confirming that the link-state information has been successfully received.

These OSPF packets indicate that the OSPF routers in the network are detecting the change in the topology and reacting to it by updating their link-state databases and routing tables.
