Initially, the route was as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item as1rb: this is the only router attached to h1b
    \item as1rc: AS1's border gateway router with AS2
    \item as2ra: AS2's border gateway router with AS1
    \item as2rb: this is the only router attached to h2b
    \item h2b: the destination
\end{enumerate}

After bringing the interface down, the route changed to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item as1rb: this is the only router attached to h1b
    \item as1ra: AS1's border gateway router with AS3
    \item as3rc: AS3's border gateway router with AS1
    \item as3ra: AS3's border gateway router with AS2
    \item as2rc: AS2's border gateway router with AS3
    \item as2rb: this is the only router attached to h2b
    \item h2b: the destination
\end{enumerate}

From the traceroute, it can be seen that the traffic is routed through AS3, since a necessary interface in the border gateway router between AS1 and AS2 was brought down. After bringing the interface back up, the original route is restored.\\
